  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">nice design, but the food looks mediocre.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>I love the header, it's very appealing.  I think the layout on whole is well done and easy to read.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">It looks beautiful. I really like the way the logo looks and the picture of the food looks very appetizing. This is a place I would try. It looks upscale and great for someone who wants a nice meal and night on the town. I would recommend keeping this as it is.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>I think  that the food looks delicious.  I like that they have an online reservation app because that is so much easier than being put on hold. I also love the font and the amount of information that it has available especially the menus online.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">the website is brightly colored which is nice, but it seems a bit too busy. I think removing the wording on the food would help tone down the page a bit.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>It looks okay...I'd say maybe add the contact information to the front page instead of having a link for it. That's probably the number one thing people will look for and saving them a click is a good idea. Oh, and hours of operation are a good idea to put on the front page, too.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">design of this website is very good; I want to go there.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>Very colorful and gives an exciting look. The picture is glittering and attractive. Totally shining and good.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>9</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">Make logo smaller, put phone number on main page so customers don't have to hunt for it</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>I like the close up picture of the food, it makes me hungry!</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>11</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">now this is different I think this is really nice and you can make your reservations online so you dont have to call someone and get stuck on hold this is great.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>My first impression is upscale. It looks nice and the images used are pleasing. I would like to take time exploring it more and   particularly look at the menu since the picture of food used is appealing.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>13</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">I think it is really bright and eye catching. I love the make a reservation tab on the right and the bar at the top makes it easy to find things on the website. The picture makes me want to eat there.</td>
  </tr>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>A website which looks more trendy, colorful and good in all respects.It catches the attention of everyone who uses it. It is one of the beautiful websites I have ever seen.</td>
  </tr>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>15</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">The banner looks great and is appealing. Too much white space though.</td>
