<hr>
Hello people of the Internet! We want you to know your rights and our rights and so we have prepared this agreement ("user agreement" or "terms") between frankfeed ("we", "our," "us") and you. This agreement sets the terms of your use of the frankfeed website and services ("frankfeed.com"). This agreement is meant to encourage a fair place for everyone involved.
<hr>
<h3>legal stuff</h3>
This agreement is a legal contract between you and us. You acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. If you do not agree to this agreement, you should not use frankfeed. Please take a look at frankfeed’s privacy policy too — it explains how we collect and use your information. 
<hr>
<h3>your access to frankfeed</h3>
Without advance notice and at any time, we may, for violations of this agreement or for any other reason we choose: (1) suspend your access to frankfeed, and/or (2) suspend or terminate Your Account.
<hr>
<h3>your frankfeed account</h3>
To participate on frankfeed, you may need to supply an email address or create an account that includes a username and password. Of course, you can also browse frankfeed without logging in.
<br><br>
You are solely responsible for the information associated with Your Account and anything that happens related to Your Account.
<hr>
<h3>payment information</h3>
You may also submit your debit or credit card information ("Payment Information") via the website to purchase services. frankfeed uses third party service providers to process your payment information. If you submit your Payment Information, you agree to pay all costs that you incur, and you give us permission to charge you when payment is due for an amount that includes any applicable taxes, fees, and charges to frankfeed or one of our service providers.
<br><br>
We grant you the right to access the frankfeed content in the manner described in this agreement. You may not otherwise reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform, or publicly display frankfeed content, except as permitted by the doctrine of fair use or as authorized in writing by us.
<br><br>
By submitting user content to frankfeed, you grant us a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform, or publicly display your user content in any medium and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, and to authorize others to do so.
<br><br>
Please take a look at frankfeed’s privacy policy for an explanation of how we may use or share information submitted by you or collected from you.
<hr>
<h3>we don’t endorse user content</h3>
We take no responsibility for, we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, and we do not assume any liability for any user content submitted by you to frankfeed.
<br><br>
We support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a frankfeed security issue, please send an <a href="http://frankfeed.com/contact">contact us</a>.
<hr>
<h3>children and frankfeed</h3>
frankfeed is not directed at people under the age of 18, and frankfeed does not knowingly collect any personal information from such people. 
<br><br>
Please read the following very carefully. Each of the following sections applies to the maximum extent permitted by law. Where jurisdictions do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, the contents of this section may not apply.
<hr>
<h3>indemnity</h3>
All the things you do and all the information you submit or post to frankfeed remain your responsibility. Indemnity is basically a way of saying that you will not hold us legally liable for any of your user content or actions that infringe the law or the rights of a third party or person in any way.
<br><br>
Specifically, you agree to hold frankfeed, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and third party service providers harmless from and defend them against any claims, costs, damages, losses, expenses, and any other liabilities, including attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or related to your access to or use of frankfeed, your violation of this user agreement, and/or your violation of the rights of any third party or person.
<hr>
<h3>limitation of liability</h3>
We will not be liable for any special, consequential, indirect, incidental, punitive, reliance, or exemplary damages, whether in tort, contract, or any other legal theory, arising out of or in any way connected with this agreement or your use of or attempt to use frankfeed, including (but not limited to) damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data. This limitation on liability shall not be affected even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some states do not allow for the exclusion of implied warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions may not apply to you. You may have other rights that vary from state to state.  
<br><br>
You agree to release us, our affiliates, and third-party service providers, and each employee, agent, and officer, from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential), of every kind and nature, known and unknown, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected to your use of frankfeed. We are not responsible for any decisions you make based on something you receive from frankfeed.
<hr>
<h3>governing law</h3>
We want you to enjoy frankfeed, so if you have an issue or dispute, you agree to raise it and try to resolve it with us informally. You can contact us with feedback and concerns <a href="http://frankfeed.com/contact">here</a>.
<br><br>
Any claim or dispute between you and us arising out of or relating to this user agreement, in whole or in part, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Indiana without respect to its conflict of laws provisions. We agree and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal court located in Bartholomew County, Indiana.
<hr>
<h3>severability and enforcement</h3>
If any provision of this user agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be modified to the extent necessary to render it enforceable without losing its intent. If no such modification is possible, that provision will be severed from the rest of this agreement.
<br><br>
If we do not enforce any right or provision in this user agreement, that is not to be deemed a waiver of our right to do so in the future.
<hr>
<h3>changes to this user agreement</h3>
This user agreement is the entire agreement between you and us concerning frankfeed. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and us. We may modify this user agreement at any time. By continuing to use frankfeed after a change to this agreement, you agree to those changes.
<hr>
This user agreement is effective as of december 6, 2014.
