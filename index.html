<p>Technology is good, but imperfect</p>
<p>My devices do amazing things, but I've always had issues capturing my ideas with them.</p>
<p>There is no simple way to send notes to your devices.</p>
<p>Apparently, having computers "read" and "listen" is a difficult endeavor, because I've never had my computer do either one of these things well. Typos abound.</p>
<p>REMOVE ME TSOON. Technology is a wonderful thing.
  
  It allows us to learn and create with unprecedented versatility. 
  
  At the same time, it's imperfect. We have many areas that need improvement.
  
  Even with the latest gear, use technology to create can be problematic.
  
  My computer and phone are unbelievably useful for most things, but when it comes to capturing ideas, they fall behind.
  
  There are too many things that distract me from creating: a new email, a browser filled with links, infinite video to stream, a search function that solves most problems.
  
  To combat these distractions, I've taken a step back.
  
  Pen & Paper have been a boon to my productivity.
  
  But this method comes with a catch.
  
  Getting ideas from my paper to my devices has been proven problematic.
  
  I've tried software that "reads" my notes, but there are always errors.
  
  What if there were an easier way?
