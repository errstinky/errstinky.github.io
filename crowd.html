<table style="width:100%">
    <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">As a new person to crowd sourcing it seems to be a lucrative way for workers to generate extra income while supplying a decent means for tasks that need human interaction is needed.  It seems very balanced, quid pro quo.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>I think Crowdsourcing is a great way to cut out the middle man and get direct information or support form your potential userbase.  Furthermore, it's a great way just to determine a product or service's potential userbase and determine overall viability in the market.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">I think its a good way to make money and started out that way. But with anything there are bad apples, and people who try and make it into their own game, a bad game that is. But I think for the most part is a great idea.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>I think crowd sourcing is a great way for employers to post work and people to make money. Basically it is a win win for everyone.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">I think crowd sourcing is a good way to get mundane tasks done. If you have a lot of small tasks that need.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>Crowdsourcing is one of the most efficient and effective means of doing repetitive easily broken up task that are difficult for a computer to do but simple for a human.  These would include things like searching of a map for anomalies or trying to identify certain things.  It is an incredibly useful tool and is for the people using it and the money is a good incentive for the workers.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">It is an interesting idea to use some kind of swarm intelligence. You get better results for filtering out stuff and good survey results since you have a large amount of audience/workers. The other side of the medal can be found in the real industry some jobs get lost since they are no longer needed or paid too poorly since it is cheaper to pump things into a crowdsourcing enviroment. Also crwodsourcing wages suck for workers in western countries. Many people from the eastern worl, e.g. India, can keep payments low, since they have way lower life costs</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>I think crowdsourcing is an excellent way to get work done. You can post jobs available to anyone, anywhere and it ends up being cheaper then having actual employees. The ones doing the work benefit as well, since they can work whenever they want from wherever they are. Every body wins.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>9</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">It is said that crowsourcing is offering online short task where one can complete the online task and get paid. But I never seen any online task on any source. Till now I could not understand how to work on crowdsourcing site or work for them on other site. Many times I tried to sign up on this site never succeed.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>I think it's a good way to divy up a larger task or goal into manageable bits and then use the intelligence of the masses to self moderate the results.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>11</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">I think it's great. Any time we can create more work/jobs for others, that can ease the job of another person, is fantastic. Although I wish they paid more fairly. Some crowdsourcing only pays about 4/hr, and that's just not fair. I wish that they would have an accurate salary.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>Crowdsourcing is an effective way to gather information or funds. A large population will generally balance out any incorrect elements in data received. Combining data from many sources can provide excellent results.</td>
