<br>
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of and/or registration with frankfeed will constitute your agreement to our policy.

Additionally, our Privacy Policy is part of our User Agreement, and by using frankfeed you agree to both.
<hr>
<h3>about this policy</h3>
We collect some information in order for you to have an account you can use to participate on the site, and other information that is necessary to make the service work. <b>We will never sell or profit from the information you share with us</b>.
<br>
We do take efforts to make sure the platform keeps working. We also share your information when we are legally required to do so. <b>Please read this privacy policy carefully</b>. It describes what information we collect, how it is used, and when it is shared so you can make smart decisions about how you use frankfeed! We think it strikes a good balance and respects you – our users – who make this whole thing possible. Let us know what you think.

When you create an account, you are required to provide a username, password and an email address. We also log, and retain indefinitely, the IP address from which the account is initially created.

If we are going to release your information, we will do our best to provide you with notice in advance unless we are prohibited by court order from doing so (e.g., an order under 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)).
<br>
Other extraordinary circumstances may require disclosure: we may also disclose your information when we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person; to address fraud, security, or spam; or to protect our rights or property.
