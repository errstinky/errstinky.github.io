    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">Reality Tv is too staged. it is not reality. Yes, the people are real, maybe, but the scripts are written to draw an audience. I do not watch. Now I will watch reality shows like dancing with the stars. it is entertaining. But not big brother, too staged. Also it shows how young people in these days like to stab each other in the back for advancement. You cannot trust people .</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>The shows classified as 'Reality TV' are a sad excuse for what some would call entertainment. Of the few times I've been subjected to Reality TV, the needless drama simply stresses me out, leaving me lacking an understanding of why people care.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">I normally don't watch reality TV.  I find it is scripted to showcase and encourage the very worst aspects of human nature.  The people involved are usually vapid and narcissistic.  I'd much rather watch something beautifully written and acted by true artists who have honed their skills and elevate entertainment.</td>

    <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>I like that it cuts away all the fluff that normally surrounds tradiitional tv</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">I do not like reality TV because despite it's name, it's mostly scripted or created after the shooting occurs. I'm not a fan because it isn't real but it is sold as such.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>My least favorite aspect of reality TV is that it is never reality TV.  Everything is put on or an act because people know that they are on TV and are told in order to get more ratings there need to be drama on the show.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">I guess its pretty entertaining. The people who go on it are so stupid that it's fun to sit and watch to laugh at them.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>I abhor reality TV - ignorant people being paid WAY too much money for public displays of stupidity.</td>

    <td>9</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">My least favorite aspect are the terrible egotistical people on the shows.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>My favorite aspect or reality TV shows such as Jerry Springer is watching white trash guests swear every two sentences and fight on stage.  I love obviously fake reality talk shows are.  It seems every time someone gets on stage there is a fight, which shows it is obviously staged.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>11</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">I just like the drama. I mean, I know it's so fake and scripted, and that it's awful to watch, but it gets you emotionally invested into the people on the show.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>I like reality TV pawn shows a lot.  They show people in real life.</td>

    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">I like the humorous aspects that make me laugh.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>I don't think reality TV in the sense that it's actual reality exists.  All reality TV is highly scripted for the audience its being presented to.</td>

    <td>15</td>
    <td bgcolor="#e0d9fa">I dislike reality TV overall, so nothing is my favorite about it.</td>
