  <tr>

    <td>Glen Lerner is a douche canoe.  This looks like a douchebag in a blue shirt and red tie.  I do not like him.  Somebody stab me in the eyes with a fork please.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Pretty standard boiler plate ambulance chaser ad.  This jock, turned slimy lawyer with his big white grin is a total turn off.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>He looks like a jerk and that doesn't look legitimate.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>I think the guy looks like a tool.. He should be wearing a suit and it doesnt have a look that you could think that he would help you as an attorney. I think his appearance is too vibrant which make it look more strange..</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>That is one happy fellow.  I'm thinking I don't need to worry about calling Saul, this guy looks slick.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>good advertisement, the model has a good smile and the top button on the shirt being unbuttoned lends a feeling of hard working.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>It looks pretty cheesy. He looks like a dumb jock.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>very shiny. Not your everyday person. The smile just seems really fake to me.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>Lawyers are jerks. This guy looks like he knows how to spend my money better than I do. This person couldn't be trusted. He's only out for the money that could be had.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>I think it's nothing that interesting, it is just like many lawyer's ads.
</td>

    <td>11</td>
    <td>This advertisement appears to professional and appealing at the same time. If I needed an attorney and saw this advertisement I might call the number listed.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>Looks like you average every day injury attorney ad, I don't like the fake marble background, the drop shadow glow around the attorney or his fake smile.  It just doesn't inspire trust or confidence.  I'd also look for a free consultation if I was looking to contact an attorney.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>13</td>
    <td>He looks like a good attorney
</td>
  </tr>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>He looks like a poster child for Ambulance Chasers the world over.
</td>
  </tr>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>The lawyer looks to be trusting and competent.  According to the advertisement, a person can call 24/7 and that would be covenant for a person that needs those hours.  It's a good advertisement to get customers.</td>
